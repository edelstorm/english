# Introduction to the Edelstorm training

***

**Welcome to the Edelstorm.io documentation!**

Before we start the creation of your website, here is a short introduction that will let you know what you need to start and that will help you to be more familiar with the technical aspect of the training.

## What you need

Make sure that you have the listed items at your disposal before starting:

* Your payment card

* An email address

* A relatively stable Internet connexion (that will not stop every 5 minutes)

You should also use:

* Google Chrome. If you do not use this browser, download it <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">here</a>. It's free and the tools you are going to use work better with it. Internet Explorer is prohibited and using Firefox can generate a few problems.

* An up to date OS (operating system) Apple, Windows or Linux. (If you are on a Mac or Windows, you have the kind of right OS.)

* A coffee or a tea! :coffee::wink:

## What we use
We will use three tools to build your website: 

  * [**Amazon Web Service (AWS)**][1]: it is an on-demand cloud computing service. Which means that it will **allow you to create a server[^1]**, so you can put your website online and to buy a domain name[^2]. 
   There are other companies that offer those kinds of services but we think, with the experience, that AWS offers greater freedom of action and is really more **simple to manage**. Once your website is online, you will almost never have to use it again. Also, AWS **most secure solution on the market**. 
   And finally, if more user comes to visit your website, AWS allows you to make the capacities your website to grow.

  * [**Wordpress**][2]: is a CMS or “content management system“. It will allow you to customize your website as you vision it, without having to touch the "code".
   It's a very powerful platform that will let you manage your content without having technical knowledge. However, you will have to get used to this tool, but we will show you how to use it.

  * [**Envato**][3]: it's on this website that you will buy your theme. A theme is the graphic base of your website. It impacts the visual part of your website (colors, design, content layout...). It's like a "pattern" that you can customize. 
   The theme is important because it's thanks to it that you won't have to create your website design, which can take time and require web development knowledge.

 [^1]: A server is a distance virtual computer. It allows you, among other things, to receive emails, stock data and access the web.
 [^2]: A domain name is an address where the users can go to visit your website. For example, the domain name of Edelstorm is edelstorm.io.
